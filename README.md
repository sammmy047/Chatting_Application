# Chat application in Java using Client-Server

In this project, A Multithreaded Client-Server Architecture based application
is implemented which works like a chat room. Since Java has a most dominant impact
on Network Programming timeline and this application problem inherently come up
with network involvement plus concurrency and synchronization in parallel operations
of clients. Java is also good in multithreading solutions. So, Java platform will be used
in the development of this project and all the sources will be tested and build using
JDK later JVM. The server will run continuously receiving requests from connecting
clients and grant access to the users using Java Socket Programming Primitives.
