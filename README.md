# Chat application in Java using Client-Server

In this project, A Multithreaded Client-Server Architecture based application
is implemented which works like a chat room. Since Java has a most dominant impact
on Network Programming timeline and this application problem inherently come up
with network involvement plus concurrency and synchronization in parallel operations
of clients. Java is also good in multithreading solutions. So, Java platform will be used
in the development of this project and all the sources will be tested and build using
JDK later JVM. The server will run continuously receiving requests from connecting
clients and grant access to the users using Java Socket Programming Primitives. 

Client Side Outputs :

From the below figure we can observe the client area terminal where the middle portion is used
to display the messages between the client and server. The box at the bottom is used to
represent the input text area where the user can enter the test. we can observe that the client has entered the data and this data is
displayed in the text area. We can also see the server’s response to the client’s message in the client area.

Server Side Outputs: 

From the given figure we can observe the server side of the output where the client
has sent a message to the server and the reply given by the server to the client.
